## Description
Watch or Pass started as a project for the 2nd year 1st semester course Software Development in Leiden University. In this app you will be given 30 actors out of top 1000 actors list of IMDB. To like an actor user swipes right, and to dislike an actor user swipes left. At the end of 30 swipes, the user gets a movie reccomendation based on their liked/disliked actors. This process can be repeated with choosing swipe again feature after the movie reccomendation, with each session being independent of each other.
